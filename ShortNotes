Error Handlers:
----------------
Processor level > flow level> application level (Precedence level)

If Flow has error handler.
	Scenario1 :Then it will try to evaluate the scope and upon matching it will throw whatever mentioned in scope.
	Scenario2: Then it will try to evaluate the scope and upon NOT matching it will throw as deafult handler exception(not to care abt the scope in default handler)
	
If Flow has Not error handler.
	It will go for default handler and try to execute the scope defined in defalut handler.
	
Subflow Error will be similar to Tibco
